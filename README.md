# CS:GO Case Opening Simulator
I'm too broke to actually open CS:GO cases so I made a case opening simulator

Mil-Spec (Blue): 79.81% (ST = 6.99%)

Restricted (Purple): 16.26% (ST = 1.64%)

Classified (Pink): 3.15% (ST = 0.48%)

Covert (Red): 0.57% (ST = 0.021%)

Gold (Knife or Gloves): 0.21% (ST = 0.0041%)

Notes:

Oct 26: After adding a delay to the simulator, I found that it makes the experience more fun and engaging. Learned 
something interesting about UI.
